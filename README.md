# Web service for image classification

## Python deployment on Hugging Face
hugging face deployment:https://huggingface.co/spaces/NehaBardeDUKE/ComputerVision_540

For the hugging face deployment i have used a pre-trained model -resnet18 and fine tuned it using images generated by hitting the Dall -E api and original art work.

Hugging face Spaces only require an app.py script and the requirements.txt. In the app.py, i call the model1.pth , load its weights and run inference on the image that i accept from the UI. 

Any new models simply need to be updated in the app.py and after saving the space rebuilds and deloys on its own. The space uses a 2 core CPU and is always available.

Below is the image classification it is trained to do-

## Rust deployment using Actix

For the rust deployment i used the same pre-trained resnet18 model but didnot fine tune it. This time is it thus trying to only infer what the image is based on the imagenet dataset it was trained on.

There is however a problem when the docker image gets built. The shared libtorch file apprears to be missing. Once i am able to fix this, the rust app as well can be deployed on AWS.
